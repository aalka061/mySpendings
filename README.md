# my_spendings

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This my first project working with Flutter. It is a simple one screen application that allows a user to add and delete expenses. In addition, Chart bar is displayed to show the recent expenses in the past 7 days and how they compare to each other. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
